# How i hack myself 🚀

Hey there! Ready to dive into the world of security? Today, we’ll explore some key concepts to keep your apps safe and sound. From the OWASP Top 10 to passwords and WAFs, we've got you covered. Let’s jump in!

## What We’ll Cover 😏

### Intro 👋
- **Welcome!**: Today’s session will be all about understanding and improving security. We’ll cover the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, explore common attack types, discuss why secure passwords are crucial, and learn about Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation in keeping your applications safe.

### The OWASP Top 10: Your Security Checklist 🔍
- **What’s OWASP?**: OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project, a nonprofit that focuses on improving software security. They provide a list of the top 10 most critical security risks to help you prioritize your security efforts.
- **Top 10 Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Injection**: This is when an attacker can send malicious data into your application. Examples include SQL injection (manipulating your database queries) and OS command injection (executing commands on your server). To protect against these, always use parameterized queries and validate input.
  - **Broken Authentication**: Poorly implemented authentication can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. Use strong, multi-factor authentication and secure your session management.
  - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: If you’re not encrypting sensitive data, it could be exposed. Always use encryption for data at rest and in transit.
  - **XML External Entities (XXE)**: XXE attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers to access internal files or perform server-side request forgery. Disable XML external entity processing in your parsers.
  - **Broken Access Control**: Ensure users can only access data and functions they’re authorized to. Implement proper access controls and validate user permissions.
  - **Security Misconfiguration**: This includes having unnecessary features enabled or default configurations. Regularly review and update your configurations and disable unused features.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into webpages. Sanitize and escape user input to prevent these attacks.
  - **Insecure Deserialization**: This can lead to remote code execution if untrusted data is deserialized. Avoid deserializing untrusted data and use safe libraries.
  - **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Ensure your dependencies are up to date and free from known vulnerabilities. Regularly check for updates and security advisories.
  - **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Without proper logging, detecting and responding to attacks can be difficult. Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activities.

### Common Attack Types and How to Handle Them 🛡️
- **Snoper Attack**: This involves an attacker snooping on network traffic to capture sensitive information. Use encryption and secure network protocols to protect your data in transit.
- **Brute Force Attack**: Attackers try many passwords or encryption keys until they find the right one. Implement account lockout mechanisms and use CAPTCHAs to mitigate these attacks.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Similar to brute force but uses a list of common passwords or phrases. Encourage the use of strong, unique passwords and implement rate limiting.

### Why Secure Passwords Matter 🔑
- **Password Security**: Use long, complex passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words.
- **Password Storage**: Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2, along with salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.
- **Password Management**: Use password managers to generate and store strong passwords securely. They also help in managing passwords for different accounts effectively.

### Web Application Firewalls (WAF) 🔥
- **What’s a WAF?**: A Web Application Firewall sits between your web app and the internet, filtering and monitoring HTTP requests to protect against attacks.
- **Why WAFs Are Awesome**: They can block attacks like SQL injection and XSS before they reach your application. WAFs provide an additional layer of security and can help in detecting and mitigating attacks.
- **Setting Up a WAF**: Ensure your WAF is properly configured to protect against known threats. Regularly update its rules and monitor its logs to adapt to new threats.

### Best Practices for Secure Coding 🔐
- **Why Secure Coding is a Big Deal**: Writing secure code is crucial to protect your applications from vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Secure Coding Tips**: Follow best practices such as input validation, proper error handling, and least privilege principle. Regular code reviews and security testing are essential.
- **Keep Your Code in Check**: Regularly update your dependencies, patch vulnerabilities, and perform security audits to ensure your code remains secure.

### Handy Tips and Resources 📚
- **Cool Tools and Resources**: Explore tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning, and resources like the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series for coding tips.
- **Stay in the Loop**: Follow security blogs, subscribe to newsletters, and participate in security communities to stay updated on the latest trends and threats.
